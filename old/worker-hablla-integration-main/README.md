# Worker Hablla Integration

## Overview

This repository contains a Node.js automation worker designed to synchronize data between the Hablla API and Google Sheets. It handles card processing, attendant reports, and historical data cleanup within a structured CI/CD pipeline.

## Repository Integration

This worker operates in conjunction with the `worker-google-auth` repository.

* **Trigger Mechanism**: It is activated via a `repository_dispatch` event named `google_token_ready`.
* **Token Handover**: The authentication worker generates a Google Access Token and dispatches it directly to this repository's workflow payload.
* **Decoupling**: This architecture ensures that the integration worker does not need to manage long-lived Google Service Account keys, receiving only short-lived bearer tokens.

## Configuration

Configure the following secrets in your GitHub repository:

- `GOOGLE_TOKEN`: Google Sheets API access token (provided by worker-google-auth)
- `HABLLA_TOKEN`: **Workspace Token from Hablla** (recommended, doesn't expire)
- `HABLLA_WORKSPACE_ID`: Hablla workspace ID
- `HABLLA_BOARD_ID`: Hablla board ID
- `SPREADSHEET_ID`: Google Sheets spreadsheet ID
- `DB_COLABORADOR_ID`: Collaborator database spreadsheet ID

### Obtaining the Workspace Token

1. Execute a flow in Hablla Studio that uses an API component
2. In the response, the token will be available in the `Authorization` header
3. Use this value directly as `HABLLA_TOKEN`

The code automatically detects whether it's a User Token or Workspace Token and configures the headers appropriately.

## Local Testing

For local development and testing:

```bash
npm install
npm run local
```

Make sure to configure the `.env` file with your credentials before running locally.

```

## Technical Architecture

### Folder Structure
* **.github/workflows/main.yml**: Defines the GitHub Actions automation logic and environment mapping.
* **index.js**: The core logic for API communication, data parsing, and spreadsheet manipulation.
* **package.json**: Manages project metadata and the `axios` dependency.

### Functional Stages

1. **Metadata Retrieval**: Identifies specific sheet IDs within the target spreadsheet.
2. **Collaborator Mapping**: Fetches a centralized database of employees to cross-reference IDs with names.
3. **Hablla Authentication**: Performs a secure login to the Hablla API using encrypted secrets.
4. **Optimized Cleanup**: Scans the Google Sheet from bottom to top to identify and remove records older than 7 days. It includes a stop condition after 20 consecutive old rows to prevent unnecessary API calls.
5. **Data Synchronization**: Fetches new cards from the Hablla API v3 and appends them to the "Base Hablla Card" sheet.
6. **Reporting**: Generates a daily summary of service metrics (TME, TMA, CSAT) for the "Base Atendente" sheet.

## Security Implementation

### Multi-Layer Security Architecture

    G[Masking Functions] --> H[Log Protection]
    I[Sanitization] --> J[Input Validation]
    K[Formula Injection Prevention] --> L[Spreadsheet Security]
```

### Security Features

* **Zero Hardcoded Secrets**: All sensitive credentials (passwords, IDs, and tokens) are injected via GitHub Secrets or encrypted payloads.
* **Token Scoping**: Uses short-lived Google OAuth2 tokens valid only for the duration of the execution.
* **Safe Logging**: The script confirms process milestones without printing raw JSON payloads or sensitive authorization headers to the console.
* **Explicit Secret Masking**: All secrets are explicitly masked in GitHub Actions workflows using `::add-mask::`.
* **Minimal Permissions**: Workflows use `contents: read` permissions only, reducing potential damage from compromised workflows.
* **Secure Logging**: Custom `secureLog` function ensures no sensitive data is exposed in logs.
* **Spreadsheet Formula Injection Prevention**: Custom `sanitize` function prevents malicious formulas from being injected into Google Sheets.

## Data Flow Security

    participant Auth as Worker Google Auth
    participant GH as GitHub Actions
    participant Hablla as Hablla API
    participant Sheets as Google Sheets
    participant Worker as Worker Hablla Integration
    
    Auth->>GH: Dispatch Event (masked token)
    GH->>Worker: Trigger Workflow
    Worker->>Hablla: Secure Authentication
    Hablla->>Worker: Card Data
    Worker->>Sheets: Processed Data (sanitized)
    Worker->>Sheets: Cleanup Old Records
    Note over Worker,Sheets: All data is sanitized before writing
```

## Optimization Features

* **Batch Processing**: Uses `batchUpdate` for row deletions and `append` for data insertion to minimize Google Sheets API quota consumption.
* **Pagination Control**: Implements smart pagination that breaks the loop if no new records are found after two consecutive pages.
* **Rate Limiting**: Includes a `sleep` utility to respect API rate limits during heavy data insertion.
* **Efficient Cleanup**: Implements a stop condition after 20 consecutive old rows to prevent unnecessary API calls.

## Setup

### Prerequisites

1. Worker Google Auth repository configured and running
2. Hablla API credentials with appropriate permissions
3. Google Sheets with proper access permissions

### Configuration

1. Ensure all required GitHub Secrets are configured:
   - `HABLLA_EMAIL`
   - `HABLLA_PASSWORD`
   - `HABLLA_WORKSPACE_ID`
   - `HABLLA_BOARD_ID`
   - `SPREADSHEET_ID`
   - `DB_COLABORADOR_ID`
2. Deploy the `worker-google-auth` to trigger this workflow automatically.

### Environment Variables

| Variable | Description | Required |
|----------|-------------|----------|
| `GOOGLE_TOKEN` | Google OAuth2 Access Token | Yes (via dispatch) |
| `HABLLA_EMAIL` | Hablla API email | Yes |
| `HABLLA_PASSWORD` | Hablla API password | Yes |
| `HABLLA_WORKSPACE_ID` | Hablla workspace identifier | Yes |
| `HABLLA_BOARD_ID` | Hablla board identifier | Yes |
| `SPREADSHEET_ID` | Google Sheets document ID | Yes |
| `DB_COLABORADOR_ID` | Collaborator database sheet ID | Yes |

## Monitoring & Observability

* **Execution Logs**: Secure logging with masked sensitive data
* **Status Tracking**: Integration with cloud-operations-monitor for uptime tracking
* **Error Reporting**: Structured error handling with secure error messages
* **Performance Metrics**: Built-in timing and pagination tracking
